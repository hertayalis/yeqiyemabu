She once admitted she knew “The Vampire Diaries” would be a hit from the moment she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/tv/2017/02/23/vampire-diaries-kat-graham-bonnie-bennett/>shot the pilot</a>.</p><p class=dh>She had previously filmed other pilots, but none other had such financial support. The production and pretty much everyone involved – Graham included – always believed the TV series would work.</p><p class=dh>Graham confessed she felt some bizarre parallelisms between Bonnie and her own journey. Just one day after burying her grandmother, for example, she had to film the death scene of another character. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/tv/2017/02/23/vampire-diaries-kat-graham-bonnie-bennett/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>“And, usually, any major loss on the show, I had dealt with something similar in my own personal life, sans the supernatural aspect of it.”</p><p class=dh>Fortunately, Graham learned a lot about herself throughout the eight years she portrayed Bonnie on “The Vampire Diaries.” She even considered that playing that character while going through some of her darkest hours was her “saving grace.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>GRAHAM’S CAREER NOWADAYS</strong></p><p class=dh>After “The Vampire Diaries,” Kat Graham has kept herself quite busy in the entertainment industry, mainly working on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/11/10184049/netflix-operation-christmas-drop-kat-graham-interview>Netflix shows</a> and films like “How It Ends” and “The Holiday Calendar.”</p><p class=dh>Now, she is focused on working on projects that empower and uplift Black characters. Graham believes that young people need to see themselves represented in the film industry as lead characters and not only as tokens or sidekicks.</p><p class=dh>So, if she’s offered a project where characters of color are not multi-dimensional, she won’t take it. That’s probably one of the reasons why Graham has worked on so many Netflix productions as she once credited them for frequently casting diverse talent.</p><p class=dh>Graham, whose “The Vampire Diaries” character was criticized for not growing enough, added that other production companies are trying to do what <a class="me a" href=#>Netflix</a> has done consistently for years: elevate the voices and narratives of Black women.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>The couple confirmed their romance on Instagram on Valentine’s Day 2020.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/7ec63038e163624773e8f6fa00f5fa32.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Kat Graham and Cottrell Guidry on December 31, 2013 in New York City | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>KAT GRAHAM’S DATING HISTORY</strong></p><p class=dh>The “All Eyez on Me” star’s love life has made headlines a few times in the past.
