A look inside their lives and marriage.</p><p class=dh>Born William Henry Cosby Jr. on July 12, 1937, Bill Cosby rose to fame as a comedian in the 1940s. The Philadephia native appeared on variety shows such as "The Ed Sullivan Show" after iconic actor Carl Reiner <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001070/bio>discovered</a> him.</p><p class=dh>He played his breakthrough role, Alexander Scott, in the 1965 film "I Spy," which propelled him to stardom.

During an interview, Camille told her she never felt that way but added his fame changed both their lives. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprah.com/omagazine/oprah-interviews-camille-cosby/2>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Shortly after we married, his career was catapulted by [the sixties hit TV show] I Spy. So all of a sudden, we were out there, and I had so much to address, as Bill did."</p><p class=dh>Bill also starred in the hit 1989 sitcom "The Bill Cosby Show," where he played a teacher. Successful movies under his belt include "Uptown Saturday Night," "A Piece of Action," and "Let's Do It Again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/bb9d5e3e8efcc52ef2e39f5f117ef427.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Cosby and his wife, Camille at the Emmy Awards Ceremony in September 1965. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>For her part, Camille pursued the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181729/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">academic path</a>.

Additionally, she has been overseeing their financial matters and philanthropic activities.</p><p class=dh>Bill and Camille have come a long way as a couple. She dropped out of school when she was 19 to marry the comedian. During the early years of the marriage, they encountered severe challenges.</p><p class=dh>When Richard Nixon became the U.S. President, he included Bill on his list of enemies, of which the couple was not aware at that time. They experienced harassment, including their phones being tapped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4d491bd4426e444aa62ab857d46e40fa.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Camille and Bill Cosby with their daughter Evin attend the launch of the pb&Caviar store on August 7, 2008 in New York City. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALLEGED HARASSMENTS</strong></p><p class=dh>The FBI would come to their house and visit him at the studio.

Years later, when several women accused Bill of sexual assault, Camille came to his defense.</p><p class=dh>In 2014, more than a dozen women came forward accusing the legendary entertainer of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/bill-cosby-scandal/bill-cosbys-wife-camille-defends-him-sex-assault-claims-n268926>sexually assaulting them</a> decades ago. In a statement, Camille insisted that her husband was a "kind man."</p><p class=dh>She also described him as generous, funny, and a "wonderful husband, father, and friend." Her statement defending Bill came as networks began canceling projects with the actor in light of the accusations.</p><p class=dh>Among Bill's accusers was model Janice Dickinson, who alleged that the groundbreaking entertainer drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1982. Another model, Beverly Johnson, also accused him of drugging her in the mid-1980s.</p><p class=dh>In 2018, Bill was convicted of three counts of indecent assault and battery for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee, in 2004.</p><p class=dh>Camille said she was "very, very pleased" when, in 2020, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to hear part of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://abcnews.go.com/US/camille-cosby-husbands-appeal-black-lives-matter-metoo/story?id=71414696">Bill's appeal</a>.

Camille, who lived near the Pennsylvania jail where her husband was serving his sentence, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bill-cosbys-wife-camille-reacts-ahead-of-prison-release/>was ecstatic</a> over the ruling.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>NO WEDDING RING</strong></p><p class=dh>Two weeks after the comedian was released from prison, Camille was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://pagesix.com/2021/07/17/camille-cosby-without-her-wedding-ring-in-nyc/>spotted</a> in New York City not wearing her wedding ring.
