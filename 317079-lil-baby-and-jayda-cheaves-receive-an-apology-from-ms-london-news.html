Jayda Cheaves,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Lil Baby's girlfriend</a> and the mother to his young son, was targeted by the public who shamed her for staying <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">with the rapper through infidelities</a>, while Ms. London was criticized for the way she brazenly spoke about what sex with Lil Baby was like. Ms. London has returned to social media to offer up an explanation and sort of apology for the controversy, while also dropping off more information about her encounter with "The Bigger Picture" rapper.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Clearing out the air, their was a small misunderstanfing on what I said, I was drinking but what I said was factual dates were just not aligned," she tweeted.
