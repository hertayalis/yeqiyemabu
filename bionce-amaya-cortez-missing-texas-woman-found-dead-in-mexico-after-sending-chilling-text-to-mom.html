Bionce Amaya Cortez, 20, reportedly sent her mother a cryptic message on that day at 1 am during her Easter trip to see relatives in Nuevo Leon. The girl's corpse was <a href=# rel>found dumped</a> on a farm near where she had been staying with bruises on her skull, spinal cord, and thorax, according to the Nuevo Leon's prosecutors office.</p><p>Bionce's half-brother identified the victim, however,<a href=# rel>&nbsp;DNA analysis</a> is still being carried out. Bionce's family had urged people to attend a march in the main square of China just hours before the shocking discovery was made. It was reportedly the place where Cortez was last seen. Officials said that arrest warrants have been issued and the homes of the last known people to see her alive have been searched.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>2 dead, 4 injured in Louisville park mass shooting days after Old National Bank massacre</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Brian Waddill: Florida man arrested after being filmed hitting endangered lemon shark with hammer</a></p><h2 class=split><strong>Cortez stopped communicating with her family</strong></h2><p>On April 6, Bionce's family reported her missing after she stopped contacting them. She did not return home to Mission, Texas as planned on April 10. Her <a href=# rel>last message,</a> which only contained a heart emoji, was sent to her mother at 1 am before she disappeared. "I answered at 2 in the morning and that message no longer entered her phone," her mother said, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun.</a> The family grew even more concerned when the friends she had been out with returned to their respective homes and gave different accounts of what had happened to Bionce.</p><p>It is believed that they left her on a dark street alone although the reason is not yet known. "Each of the people who went with her have different stories, one says that she has not returned from Montemorelos, others say that she asked to be dropped off on a street," the young woman's mother told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sin Embargo</a>.</p><h2 class=split>Cortez's sister had urgently appealed for help</h2><p>“Please, if you know anything let me know and send me a message," her sister had said while urgently appealing for help online. "I am her sister and the last time she communicated with my mother was Sunday night and after that the messages did not come in, she had to return to Mission early Monday," she had added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRompmku6SxjJqkmrGRYrCwvtOesWalmajAqrrGZquesJGoeri7zJqlZp6fqrulecOemJ1lmaN6rrHXopqoZZGbwaa%2BjKycp5yZo7Rur8eio6Whnpx6tbHXrWStp12ivK4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./white-lotus-cast-emmys-january-2024-8426452.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'The White Lotus' Cast at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sand-fleas-deadliest-catch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Are Sand Fleas on 'Deadliest Catch'?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./773357-deion-sanders-reacts-deiondras-pregnancy-jokes-granddaddy-hip-hop-news.html>Deion Sanders Reacts To Deiondra's Pregnancy, Jokes About Being A &amp;quot;Granddaddy&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirara-asuka-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Kirara Asuka Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lucky-spencers-exit-from-gh.html>Lucky Spencer's exit from GH - General Hospital</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prince-william-kuwait-trip.html>Prince William Follows Prince Charles &amp;amp; the Queen's Footsteps in Kuwait</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rajon-rondo-bio-height-team-net-worth-and-more.html>Rajon RondoBio, Height, Team, Net Worth and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
