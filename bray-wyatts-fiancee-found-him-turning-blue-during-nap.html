breathing and “turning blue,” according to the report.&nbsp;</p><p>Offerman’s mother attempted CPR while Offerman called 911.</p><p>Wyatt was later pronounced dead at the hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=#>tragic incident</a> occurred months after Wyatt had COVID-19 and developed heart complications from it.</p><p>Doctors had recommended to Wyatt that he keep a heart defibrillator with him.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s unclear if it would have saved Wyatt’s life, the defibrillator was not on him when he died and it was later found inside his vehicle in the driveway, according to TMZ.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Wrestler Bray Wyatt — born Windham Rotunda — died last week. <span class=credit>Getty
