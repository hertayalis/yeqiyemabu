Next on the docket is his major shift over to the DCU, where he’s set to steer the franchise in new, and hopefully far more successful, directions.</p><p data-characters=518 data-current-count=895 data-injectable=true>Gunn is well-known for leaning on similar actors over multiple roles, a tendency he’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fully willing to claim</a>. He enjoys working with the cast and crew he’s come to know and trust over the years, and fans expect he’ll maintain this trend even after making the full move over to DC. With this in mind, and recent news about a Guardians actor in talks for the DCU’s Lex Luthor at the forefront of their minds, fans know exactly which background Guardians star they’d like to see in the role.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>There are a few dozen options, spread across three Guardians movies and one Christmas Special, but one would easily take the cake. While we can’t deny the appeal of a quirky Sean Gunn Luthor — or a major switch-up with someone like Benicio del Toro — one recent Guardians addition easily takes the cake.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>After making his debut in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, the scintillant Martinex returned for a minor role in Vol. 3. His glittery skin might raise some eyebrows, but beneath that lustrous exterior might just be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the perfect man for the job.</a> After all, Michael Rosenbaum <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has plenty of experience to back him up</a>.</p><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>Non-Smallville fans might be knitting their eyebrows together as they examine Rosenbaum’s average, but attractive, appeal, but longtime fans of the 10-season series instantly pegged the actor as the perfect — and potentially hilarious — fit for the part. After starring alongside Tom Welling as the show’s own Lex Luthor, it would be kismet for the star to turn full circle and once again step into the menacing DC villain’s shoes. It would also be pretty hilarious, as one fan pointed out on Twitter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This would be the funniest outcome <a href=#>https://t.co/AHQMycbMOc</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EqNZev2ug3</a></p>— Smv (@Smv_of_Heroes) <a href=#>May 15, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=707 data-injectable=true>Noting that Rosenbaum would easily be “the funniest outcome,” Twitter user @Smv_of_heroes ignited a spectacular flurry of fan casting in the wake of their tweet. While options like Seth Rogen for Luthor — alongside Jonah Hill’s Superman, of course — would certainly get fan attention, we just don’t know if Vin Diesel has the chops (though he’s got the bald pate down pat).</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>Rosenbaum is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an easy favorite for the part</a>, among fans at least, and his return to the role would feel cyclical and fitting. He exited the role of Luthor after seven seasons of Smallville but returned to give Clark some grief for the show’s final arc. That was more than a decade ago, and fans would be far from disappointed to see the actor bring everything he’s learned over 10 years of additional experience to reimagine the part.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>Quite a few people continue to see Rosenbaum as “peak Lex Luthor,” after all, so why not? That alone should land him on Gunn’s shortlist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooJ9lkWK0tq3RnaCapqNiw6bAxKuYp2Wimq6tuNhmoKxlmaN6tbTEZqmupp6eu6h5xaipZqSVrXqtwdOhpqtlpJ2yr3nOp5xmm5iktqSxjKKqZp2RqLatxYytn55lnaTAtXnFoqutoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./maybach-music-group.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>maybach music group</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anne-pramaggiore.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Anne Pramaggiore net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./773357-deion-sanders-reacts-deiondras-pregnancy-jokes-granddaddy-hip-hop-news.html>Deion Sanders Reacts To Deiondra's Pregnancy, Jokes About Being A &amp;quot;Granddaddy&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirara-asuka-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Kirara Asuka Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lucky-spencers-exit-from-gh.html>Lucky Spencer's exit from GH - General Hospital</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prince-william-kuwait-trip.html>Prince William Follows Prince Charles &amp;amp; the Queen's Footsteps in Kuwait</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rajon-rondo-bio-height-team-net-worth-and-more.html>Rajon RondoBio, Height, Team, Net Worth and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
