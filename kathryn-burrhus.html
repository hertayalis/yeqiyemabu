However, to deviate from our normal preconception, we will discuss the popular wrestler’s wife, Kathryn Burrhus.</p><p>There is a lot of information on Kathrynn’s spouse, Stone Cold Steve Austin, but little to no information about Burrhus. So, without further ado, let’s dive into the article to learn more about Burrhus.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Kathryn_Burrhus_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Kathryn Burrhus? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>As previously said, Kathryn Burrhus rose to prominence after marrying a former professional wrestler, hence there is no information on whether or not she was active in any profession. As a result, determining her net worth is difficult.</p><p>Though Kathryn’s net worth is unclear, her ex-husband Steve’s net worth as of 2019 is $50 million. He made a lot of money from his numerous careers as a professional wrestler, actor, producer, and television personality. Furthermore, the 54-year-old wrestler was one of the most successful wrestlers in the WWE Universe, and he is the only wrestler to have won three Royal Rumbles, as well as the title of 1996 King of the Ring.</p><p>Kathryn’s ex-husband, Steve Austin, shared a photo of a stunning automobile on Instagram, Image Source: Instagram@steveaustinbsr</p><p>Burrhus, who was briefly married to Stone Cold, allegedly received spousal assistance from her ex-husband. Although the precise amount is unknown, she must have received a million dollars as part of the divorce settlement.</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Stardom>Rise to Stardom</span></h2><p>Kathryn Burrhus was born in the United States of America on August 29, 1952. She is 66 years old as of 2019. So far, there are no more details about her parents, siblings, or early life, as she rose to prominence following her marriage to American retired professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin.</p><h2><span id=Kathryn_Burrhus-_Relationship>Kathryn Burrhus- Relationship</span></h2><p>She was the wife of Steve Austin, an American former professional wrestler, actor, producer, and television host, as previously stated. The former couple met in high school and began dating.</p><p>After a year of dating, Burrhus and Steve exchanged wedding vows on November 24, 1990, in the presence of their families, friends, and loved ones.</p><p>Their relationship, however, did not progress well because they had misunderstandings and disagreements with each other. Steve was discovered dating Jeanie Clark, which caused Kathryn and Steve’s marriage to terminate on August 7, 1992.</p><p>Austin married Clarke on December 18, 1992, following his divorce from Kathryn. Despite the fact that the former professional wrestler married, Kathryn is not in a relationship and is still single. As of now, she avoids social media, therefore there is no information about her personal life available.</p><h2><span id=Kathryn_Burrhus-_Professional_Career>Kathryn Burrhus- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Kathryn Burrhus has not disclosed any information about her job, although her husband, Steve Austin, is a former professional wrestler, actor, producer, and television host from the United States. From 1991 to 1995, he competed in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In late 1995, he signed with the World Wrestling Federation after a brief stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW).</p><p>Austin also won 19 championships during his wrestling career.
