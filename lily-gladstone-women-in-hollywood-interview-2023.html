Boots, Paul Andrew, $1,495.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-dropcap css-pvd5q0 et3p2gv0">Lily Gladstone recently debuted in Cannes, posing alongside her friend and Killers of the Flower Moon costar, Leonardo DiCaprio, wearing Valentino: a devastatingly beautiful black cashmere cape with abstract floral embellishments that seemed made for her alone. The cape was from Valentino’s fall 2022 couture, part of a collection that, per the brand, “broadens the spectrum of beauty” by centering the formerly peripheral, turning “into protagonists those who, once, did not even have supporting roles.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">That’s Native women in a nutshell, especially in Hollywood. We’re rarely portrayed as people with scope or dynamism, but Gladstone, who has Blackfeet (Siksikaitsitapi) and Nez Perce (Nimíipuu) heritage, never makes herself smaller. “I’m not sure I know how to dissolve in the background,” she tells me via Zoom, leaning in so close to the screen that it cuts off the top of her head. She’s been subverting the lens for years, as in her 2016 performance in Kelly Reichardt’s Certain Women, which offers a rare depiction of a queer Native woman. (“I’ve been really lucky that my career has largely been shaped by women filmmakers,” she says.) Now her performance in the Martin Scorsese–helmed Killers could make her the first Native person in history nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.</p><img alt="lily gladstone wih 2023" title="lily gladstone wih 2023" width=2608 height=3263 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elm120123fobcover-digital7-656694595b33b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Mark Seliger</span><p>Blouse, Max Mara, $995.

Earrings, Mahnaz Collection, $8,500.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Who better to challenge the common perception than a Native actor who’s been known to fight for better representation, equity, and equality, even when it carries a cost? During Gladstone’s sophomore year at the University of Montana, where she was studying drama, the department decided to add Peter Pan to its fall slate. She was the only Native woman student in the department at the time, so people told her she’d be “a shoo-in for the role of Tiger Lily,” she said in 2019. She refused to prepare an audition, even though students were expected to read for every production. Taking the stand isolated her, but motivated her to expand the way Native people are seen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Recently, she was photographed protesting with fellow SAG-AFTRA members in Times Square, sign in hand, dancing a little, ready to fight. It’s in contrast to Gladstone’s work onscreen—somatic, focused on quiet, subtlety, and movement. “I don’t really come into these spaces pushing my presence to the front,” Gladstone says. She works from the heart, where she says her spirit lives: “The audience will know you’re feeling it if you’re feeling it.”</p><img alt="lily gladstone wih 2023" title="lily gladstone wih 2023" width=4800 height=5915 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elm120123wllilygladstone-005a-6564ed4882137.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Mark Seliger</span></p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">On her goals</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“I’ve never really been an eye-on-the-prize person. There’s a quote from Carl Sagan and Iosef Shmuelovich’s book, Intelligent Life in the Universe: ‘The prey runs to the hunter.’ That’s something that’s kind of governed what my goals are—just keep doing it, and what’s meant to find you will come to you. But really, if there’s any goal that I think I have maintained or sustained throughout, it’s just ‘Be happy.’ Be happy with what you’re doing, because it’s easy to be distracted by the trimmings and lose sight of why you’re doing it.”</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">On getting into a role mentally</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“If I’ve been a character who has to be holding a lot of trauma, I’ll make them left-handed. I’m right-handed. That takes a lot of physical work, but literally being able to hand yourself off to yourself....It’s an easier way to physiologically carve out two different spaces.”</p><img alt="lily gladstone wih 2023" title="lily gladstone wih 2023" width=4800 height=6473 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elm120123wllilygladstone-004a-6564ed710b8f9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Mark Seliger</span><p>Dress, Alexander McQueen.

A lot of it is just being present and accepting what you have. I think if you’re going to have any longevity in a field like this, it’s so unpredictable—you have to surrender and let go. I mean, case in point: I don’t know where I’m going to be this weekend. Depending on how powers outside of my control go in Hollywood, my life could go to this coast or to that coast—it’s just a little bit maddening if you don’t figure out how to surrender.”</p><img alt="lily gladstone wih 2023" title="lily gladstone wih 2023" width=4800 height=3286 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elm120123fobedletter-001-2a-6564ed926c701.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Mark Seliger</span><p>Cape, dress, $1,850, Rodarte.

So I’ve had a low level of anxiety for the last couple of years about what’s going to happen when the internet figures out who I am. So far, I’ve been very pleasantly surprised that there’s way more love than hate out there. And that goes back to community. It’s been an incredible reminder of like, Okay, maybe all these things that I’ve been saying—that representation really matters, that seeing yourself represented gives you a sense of your place in the world [resonated with people]. So my anxiety went away when I started seeing all the love and excitement and support.”</p><img alt="lily gladstone wih 2023" title="lily gladstone wih 2023" width=4800 height=6473 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elm120123wllilygladstone-003a-6564edbca5bbf.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Mark Seliger</span><p>Dress, Lauren Good Day, $162.

When I’m trying to fight it is when my hand shakes or my vocal cords start seizing up. All these little tiny, physiological ways that your body is processing all your adrenaline—they just seem to get worse the more you fight it. Having so much theater under my belt before stepping into set of film [was also helpful]. You get a little bit addicted to the rush of nerves before you go onstage. And when I’m not feeling that is when it becomes a slog. So I don’t fight them too hard. Vulnerability is what makes your work accessible to people.”</p><img alt="lily gladstone wih 2023" title="lily gladstone wih 2023" width=4800 height=6473 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elm120123wllilygladstone-006a-6564edd1774a0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Mark Seliger</span><p>Dress, Roland Mouret, $850.

I couldn’t turn around without being like, ‘Oh my God.’ First I sat next to Robbie Robertson, who I’ve loved since I was a kid. Before I did a lot of theater, I was just a little expressive, chunky ballerina who would choreograph my own dances, and I did a lot of choreography to Robbie Robertson & The Red Road Ensemble. Then I was introduced to Steven Spielberg—it was the third time that we met. We were like, ‘Oh yeah! We know each other.’ That was all in the span of 10 minutes. Margot Robbie was seated at one table; Jennifer Lawrence was at another. And in all of that, the person who was grounding for me was Leonardo DiCaprio. Like, where’s my friend? There’s my friend! What is happening? So that was a very Hollywood experience—I couldn’t turn around without a titan right there.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Hair by Bob Recine, makeup by Romy Soleimani, manicure by Casey Herman, all at The Wall Group; set design by Jakob Bokulich; produced by Ruth Levy and Madi Overstreet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong>A version of this article appears in the December 2023/January 2024 issue of ELLE.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong></strong><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X03JIM?linkCode=ogi&tag=elle_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10051.a.44763838%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7C%5Bpid%7C2b6a4c64-fd46-4ae4-8b94-950655b335ca" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="GET THE LATEST ISSUE OF ELLE" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-product-id=45e19edf-39d1-4967-832f-ee91327c2527 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X03JIM?linkCode=ogi&tag=elle_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10051.a.44763838%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7C%5Bpid%7C2b6a4c64-fd46-4ae4-8b94-950655b335ca" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X03JIM?linkCode=ogi&tag=elle_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10051.a.44763838%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7C%5Bpid%7C2b6a4c64-fd46-4ae4-8b94-950655b335ca" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X03JIM?linkCode=ogi&tag=elle_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10051.a.44763838%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7C%5Bpid%7C2b6a4c64-fd46-4ae4-8b94-950655b335ca" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"91c93b81-faf3-4605-9c92-bf0c3d25e239","site_id":"530bacd4-96b2-4cfe-a9a6-1fbd7c749e22","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=a1e77f83-7987-47d6-b3ad-380ae64d3d14 class="body-btn-link product-links-button css-qo1po4 ebsw2pb0">GET THE LATEST ISSUE OF ELLE</a><br></p><img alt="women in hollywood" title="women in hollywood" width=3502 height=1377 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/women-in-hollywood-logo-65661e178f74c.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">This story is part of ELLE’s 2023 Women in Hollywood portfolio, our annual celebration of the women we loved watching this year.
