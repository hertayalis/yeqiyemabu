Li forced Poppy to keep Luna’s paternity a secret, either by making promises to provide for Luna or threatening Poppy with suing for custody if Poppy was somehow unfit (drugs, promiscuity, breaking laws, just unable to provide for a child etc.)</p><p><strong>Scenario <span class=hashtag-raw>#2</span></strong>: Poppy is not Luna’s birth mother, but Li is! What if Li is the one who had an affair with another man? What if she got pregnant, and gave baby Luna to Poppy to raise as her own? Li would look like a total hypocrite if this is the case, and Finn would be furious! The only problem with this theory is that Jack would have noticed if Li were pregnant, and so would Finn!</p><p><strong>Scenario <span class=hashtag-raw>#3</span></strong>: Finn had a relationship with a woman while in college and got her pregnant, with baby Luna! Either Finn never found out or he found out and was made to believe that baby momma had an abortion or Miscarriage.</p><p>What if Li, paid the birth mother off and took Finn’s daughter to Poppy to raise as her own?<br>She could have done this so Finn would not ruin his future/ medical career over a “mistake” in Li’s eyes.<br>Again, Finn would never forgive Li for hiding his daughter!</p><p>Isn’t Luna a little too old to be a child of Finn’s. Luna should be around 19 -21. I would think that Finn is in his early 30’s.</p><p>If Li and Poppy are sisters then Luna would be Finn’s cousin not is niece.</p><p>If Li knew that Jack had got her sister pregnant then I think that when she was upset at Jack for having an affair with Sheila that she might also have mentioned the affair with her sister. Although it might be possible that Jack did have an affair with Poppy and perhaps she did not know about it. In which case it is possible that Jack was sending Poppy money to support Luna.</p><p>When Finn became engaged to Steffy didn’t he tell her that the ring belonged to his grandmother or was it his mother,</p><p>Finn and Li never mention any other family and no other family members attended Finn’s wedding.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Soaps rarely mention others to keep it open for writers to toss in a brother, sister, cousin, etc. Look at Eric - we never knew he had at least two brothers or Stephanie and her sister, Pam.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>You may be right about the age thing</p><p>Perhaps Li does not know that Jack had an affair with her Sister. If Jack is Luna’s dad, Finn would be her brother.</p><p>If Finn is in his 30’s and Luna is 19ish, then Finn could have gotten someone pregnant in high school, instead of what I said about College. Either way, Li may have wanted to prevent Finn’s future from being altered by early fatherhood, and had Poppy raised the baby as her own.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/woman_shrugging/6.png title=:woman_shrugging:t6: alt=:woman_shrugging:t6: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Luna can’t be the daughter of Thorne or Ridge as that would be creepy.</p><p>Bill? Not surprising and she can have another in with the family.</p><p>Taylor’s niece (via her brother) making Luna a Hamilton (and someone to be ignored after this storyline is over).</p><p>So, after listening to Luna’s phone call with her Mom yesterday, now we know she is somehow related to Li and Finn. I’m assuming Finn is her cousin, but cant figure out her obsession to the Forester family.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Didn’t Luna mention the other day that her aunt and grandfather were driven and different than she and her mom? If Li is her aunt; then who the heck is her grandfather then? When Bell decides to drop the name of her father then we will know who the grandfather is. Unless the lame writers forgot what they wrote for Luna to say that day. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thinking.png title=:thinking: alt=:thinking: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/roll_eyes.png title=:roll_eyes: alt=:roll_eyes: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/unamused.png title=:unamused: alt=:unamused: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>I wonder if Li will be the one who saves Eric (if the goal is to keep him on the show). If it is Finn, then that will make Liam’s efforts to break up Steff/Finn much harder. Now, Finn would have saved Steffy’s grandfather from dying - not sure what Liam can offer which will counter that. You can’t really complain about hugging psycho-mommy when he just saved your granddad from certain death.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Also - we know how Li is. Where are the scenes of Li confronting Liam and telling him off? Those would be awesome.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>October 8, 2023, 4:45pm <span itemprop=position>17</span></span><p>I don’t think the Finn is Luna’s father scenario works either because of their ages. Luna is in her early twenties. Finn is in his mid-thirties. He would have had to be in high school when he became a father, and while that certainly is possible, I don’t think they’d go there.</p><p>Oh, and Finn did say the engagement ring had belonged to his mother.</p><p>Poppy wanting Luna to stay away from the Forresters could be for any number of reasons. Remember when Ivy first appeared? She said her mother had a dim view of the Forresters, too, because of what she’d read about them in the press. If Luna’s mom is more the “hippy” type and not as “driven” as her Aunt Li or her grandfather, then she might not want her sucked into the Forrester vortex, especially given how Sheila appearing because Finn married a Forrester and produced a Forrester heir pretty much took a sledgehammer to Finn and Li’s lives. Also, the specific mention of “grandfather” makes it more likely that Luna’s grandfather, rather than her father, is an issue. As for Luna needing to stay away from Finn, Poppy may worry about her getting caught in Sheila’s crosshairs if she does.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I think it’s just that Finn’s mother, grandfather and himself all have money making careers while Luna and her mother have much less and Li and her father may be ashamed of them.</p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sea1.discourse-cdn.com/sheknowssoaps/message-boards/user_avatar/soaps.sheknows.com/diamond78/48/27099_2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Diamond78:<p><strong>Scenario <span class=hashtag-raw>#3</span></strong>: Finn had a relationship with a woman while in college and got her pregnant, with baby Luna!
