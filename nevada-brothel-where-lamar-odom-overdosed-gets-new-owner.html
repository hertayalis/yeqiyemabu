Stained old mattresses, red high-heels, lingerie and pink fluffy scarves are seen left behind at the sex venue formerly known as both the Cherry Patch and, later, the Love Ranch.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The ranch is situated on 75 acres of land. <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A sign outside the closed brothel reads “Ring bell … wait … when buzzer sounds pull gate open.” <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The bedrooms are completely isolated without any windows. <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Heels, under garments and other pieces of clothing are seen left behind in one of the brothels. <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A lone red high heel and a manual of some sort lies on the edge of an old bed. <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><p>Meanwhile, dark and gloomy hallways encompass the building, which lead to dreary rooms filled with several red and green worn sofas.

The Post has reached out to Fredlund for comment.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">On October 13, 2015, Lamar Odom, who had used cocaine in the days prior to falling unconscious at the brothel, suffered kidney failure, several heart attacks and 12 strokes. He became comatose and was placed on life support in a hospital in Las Vegas before regaining consciousness. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The brothel, known as “The Love Ranch,” gained notoriety after Odom, a former Laker’s basketball player, <a href=#>was found unconscious</a> there in October 2015.</p><p>Hof, who owned the Brothel since 2010 and who was the subject of HBO reality show “Cathouse,” owned seven other legal brothels in Nevada.
