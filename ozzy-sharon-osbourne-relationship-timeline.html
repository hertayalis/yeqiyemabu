Here are all of the details surrounding rock and roll's most famous couple.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>When thinking of the true elder statesmen of rock and roll music today, you'd be hard-pressed to not mention <a href=#>Ozzy Osbourne</a>. Throughout decades of sold-out concert tours, award-winning albums, and critical acclaim, Ozzy has solidified himself in the annals of rock history for generations to come.</p><p>Throughout the 21st century, fans have become increasingly more familiar with Ozzy's personal life thanks to his family's namesake reality television show. In its episodes viewers were able to paint a complete picture of the relationship that he has shared with his wife, <a href=#>Sharon Osbourne</a>, for years. However, not every important detail is addressed. So, keep reading for a complete timeline of Ozzy and Sharon's relationship.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne's relationship timeline spans decades.</h2><p>Many fans of Ozzy are only familiar with Sharon in terms of the intimate side of his life, but the rocker was actually married once before. Indeed, Ozzy was married to his first wife, Thelma Riley, from 1971 to 1982. While they were together, the British native adopted Thelma's son, Elliot, as well as gave birth to a daughter of their own named Jessica in 1972, and a son named Louis in 1975.</p><p>Ozzy's story with Sharon slightly overlaps his story with Thelma. The star met then-18-year-old Sharon in 1970 while her father, Don Arden, managed Black Sabbath. Their relationship remained cordial until 1979 when things turned romantic. Directly after Ozzy and Thelma divorced in 1982, he and Sharon were married.</p><p>Things moved quickly for the new couple who became parents to three children in the span of roughly two years. Their first child, Aimee Osbourne, was born on Sept. 2, 1983. This was closely followed by Kelly Osbourne, who was born on Oct. 27, 1984, and then Jack Osbourne, who was born on Nov. 8, 1985.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ozzy and Sharon's first rough patch came when he assaulted her in 1989.</h2><p>The couple hit a serious rough patch in 1989 when Ozzy, while under the influence of drugs, attacked Sharon and was arrested for attempted murder. After a six month stint in medical detention, Ozzy was released and the couple worked towards reconciliation. Sharon spoke about this tumultuous time in the 2020 documentary Biography: Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne.</p><p>"I had no idea who was sat across from me on the sofa, but it wasn’t my husband. He goes to a stage where he gets that look in his eyes, the shutters were down, and I just couldn’t get through to him," she said of the altercation. "And he just said, ‘We’ve come to a decision that you’ve got to die.’ He was calm — very calm — then suddenly he lunged across at me and just dived on me and started to choke me."</p><p>After medical intervention, Ozzy and Sharon seemed to get back on track.</p><p>Alongside Jack and Kelly (Aimee chose not to participate), Ozzy and Sharon gave the world a glimpse into their lives in 2002 with the premiere of their reality show The Osbournes. The hit program ran for four seasons until 2005.</p><p>Things went quiet between the two for almost a decade after the show wrapped, then rumors emerged.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cheating rumors began plaguing Ozzy and Sharon in the 2010s.</h2><p>In 2013, Ozzy was accused of cheating on Sharon amidst a relapse. He decided to address the claims on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, writing, "For the last year and a half I have been drinking and taking drugs. I was in a very dark place and was an a--hole to the people I love most, my family. However, I am happy to say that I am now 44 days sober."</p><p>Ozzy continued his message by adding, "Just to set the record straight, Sharon and I are not divorcing. I’m just trying to be a better person. I would like to apologize to Sharon, my family, my friends and my band mates for my insane behavior during this period ... and my fans."</p><p>However, that was not the last time that Ozzy dealt with cheating in his relationship.</p><p>In May of 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a> revealed that Ozzy had an affair with hairstylist Michelle Pugh, causing him and Sharon to split. "I honestly at this point today have no idea what I’m going to be doing with the rest of my life,” Sharon said of the situation while hosting The Talk at the time. "I don’t know where I’m going, who I’m going with. And I just need time to think. And really think about myself, about what do I really want for … Because I’m 63 years of age and I can’t keep living like this."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>However, just two months after that all went down, Ozzy and Sharon reconciled with the help of marriage therapy. Through it all, Ozzy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> to cheating on Sharon with six different women. In 2017, the duo renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas.</p><p>By 2020, Ozzy seemed to have put it all behind him. "I regret cheating on my wife," he said in November 2020 to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">British GQ</a>. "I don’t do it anymore."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ozzy and Sharon are standing by each other through thick and thin nowadays.</h2><p>After reaffirming their love for one another, Ozzy and Sharon have been each other's biggest advocates. When Sharon exited her role on The Talk after controversially supporting Piers Morgan, Ozzy supported her through and through. Likewise, Sharon has stood by Ozzy through <a href=#>recent health scares</a> from which he has thankfully emerged from.</p><p>On July 4, 2022, the couple celebrated 40 years of marriage together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpMe7xYysn5qqn6N6sL%2FBqKyrppViv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedOipJ6kmaOy</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-mokoko-seed-locations-on-illusion-bamboo-island-in-lost-ark.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All Mokoko seed locations on Illusion Bamboo Island in Lost Ark</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-recruit-villagers-for-campsite-village-in-lego-fortnite.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How To Recruit Villagers For Campsite/Village in LEGO Fortnite</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./773357-deion-sanders-reacts-deiondras-pregnancy-jokes-granddaddy-hip-hop-news.html>Deion Sanders Reacts To Deiondra's Pregnancy, Jokes About Being A &amp;quot;Granddaddy&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirara-asuka-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Kirara Asuka Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lucky-spencers-exit-from-gh.html>Lucky Spencer's exit from GH - General Hospital</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prince-william-kuwait-trip.html>Prince William Follows Prince Charles &amp;amp; the Queen's Footsteps in Kuwait</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rajon-rondo-bio-height-team-net-worth-and-more.html>Rajon RondoBio, Height, Team, Net Worth and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
