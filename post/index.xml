AMD offers FreeSync Premium, meaning variable refresh rate is supported, preventing screen tearing and stuttering, and much like NVIDIA’s Advanced Optimus, the discrete GPU can be turned on and off without requiring a system reboot, while still allowing for variable refresh rate, so that is a major win.</description></item><item><title>Everything the cast of Downton Abbey have said about possible return of beloved drama</title><link>/downton-abbey-will-there-be-a-new-series-all-the-cast-have-said-about-future-amid-reboot-reports.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/downton-abbey-will-there-be-a-new-series-all-the-cast-have-said-about-future-amid-reboot-reports.html</guid><description>Hugh Bonneville and more stars have opened up about the future of Downton… Downton Abbey fans are going wild with excitement because there are whispers in tinsel town that the much-adored period drama could be set to make a triumphant return to the small screen.
