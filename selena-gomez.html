But it says that she cares about him so much that even the littlest things he says can make her feel sad or upset.</p><p>"The conversation goes nowhere<br>Cause you never take me there"<br>- We never talk about anything serious because nothing will ever come out of us being anything.</p><p>"And I know what i know<br>And I know that you're no good for me<br>Yeah, I know what i know<br>And I know it's not meant to be"<br>- She knows that he isn't the right guy for her.</p><p>"He's my dilemma<br>One half me wants ya<br>And the other half wants to forget<br>- They used to have something special but something went wrong so now even though she wants to move on and forget about everything she can't because he is special to her.</p><p>"And I tell myself to run from you<br>But I find myself attracted to my dilemma"<br>- She knows that she should turn away from the whole situation but something keeps her staying there.</p><p>"Your eyes have told a thousand lies<br>But I believe them when they look in mine"<br>- Even though she knows that he lies a lot, she still wants to believe him. She wants to believe that he won't lie to her anymore.</p><p>"I heard the rumors but you won't come clean<br>I guess I'm hoping it's because of me"<br>- She knows that the rumors are true, even though he denies them. She wants to think that he won't admit to it because he doesn't want her to think of him in a bad way.</p><p>" could live with you<br>Your smile, your eyes<br>The way you make me feel inside<br>I could live with you<br>But I don't wanna "<br>- If she had to live without him she could.
