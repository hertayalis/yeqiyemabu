He is also used to describe the artistic style of Japanese author Haruki Murakami and other artists he has influenced.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Takashi_Murakami_Wiki></span><span><strong>Takashi Murakami Wiki</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Kaikai Kiki Co Ltd a management firm that Murakami founded and serves as president of, is used to oversee a number of up-and-coming talents.

By emphasising surface and utilising flat planes of colour, this style sets itself apart from the western approach.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/takashi-murakami-1.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_And_Education></span><span><strong>Family And Education</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>In Tokyo, Japan, Murakami was born and reared.

He enrolled at Tokyo University of the Arts in order to acquire the drafting abilities necessary to operate as an animator.</span></p><p><span>However, he ultimately decided to focus on Nihonga, a ‘traditional’ form of Japanese painting that uses conventional Japanese artistic conventions, techniques, and subjects.</span></p><p><span>In 1988, he received his master’s degree.
