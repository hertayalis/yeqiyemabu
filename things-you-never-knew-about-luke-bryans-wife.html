He didn't plan on going to college. He wanted to move to Nashville to pursue a career in country music. However, just days before Luke was set to leave, his older brother Chris was killed in a car accident.&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>ABC News</a> many years later, he said, "I'm kind of hyperventilating talking about it... You never truly... move beyond it." So, Luke went to college instead.</p><p dir=ltr>Then, in May 2007, when Luke and Caroline were newlyweds, his older sister Kelly died at home just a few days after organizing a group of more than 120 people to go see Luke play his debut performance at the Grand Ole Opry. The cause of death has never been determined. In that same ABC News interview, Luke said "My only older siblings... gone from the world, in a flash in two, two different, crazy, tragic manners, that... we'll never know and never understand.</p><p dir=ltr>In the meantime, Luke and Caroline have two sons. Thomas "Bo" Boyer Bryan was born in 2008. Tatum "Tate" Christopher Bryan was born in 2010. But in&nbsp;2014, tragedy struck again, and <a href=#>Luke's brother-in-law passed away,</a> leaving behind a 13-year-old son, Tilden, who is being raised by Luke and Caroline. They also took in his late sister and brother-in-law's two college-age nieces, as reported by ABC News.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9mZ4B6e9OhoKefo2LGsMGMp5yvnaJiuK%2Bx1maYm6elqXqtwcqeZJuqqZa7tHnWop2eZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dee-jay-daniels-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dee Jay Daniels Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pablo-schreiber-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pablo Schreiber Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./773357-deion-sanders-reacts-deiondras-pregnancy-jokes-granddaddy-hip-hop-news.html>Deion Sanders Reacts To Deiondra's Pregnancy, Jokes About Being A &amp;quot;Granddaddy&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirara-asuka-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Kirara Asuka Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lucky-spencers-exit-from-gh.html>Lucky Spencer's exit from GH - General Hospital</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prince-william-kuwait-trip.html>Prince William Follows Prince Charles &amp;amp; the Queen's Footsteps in Kuwait</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rajon-rondo-bio-height-team-net-worth-and-more.html>Rajon RondoBio, Height, Team, Net Worth and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
