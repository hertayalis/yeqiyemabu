During his childhood, he received care at the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, an institution he later passionately supported.</p><p>His educational journey led him to Lamar High School in Arlington, Texas, and subsequently to the University of Texas in Austin, where he earned a communications degree. Within the university’s film department, he distinguished himself as one of only twenty students specializing in the intensive Production Sequence.</p><p>Upon completing his education, Billy Miller ventured to Los Angeles, commencing his career in the mailroom of Industry Entertainment. His entry into the acting realm began when he signed with the Wilhelmina modeling agency, which opened doors for him to feature in numerous commercials.</p><p>Although he encountered a setback at 24 when he lost a screen test for CBS Daytime’s “As the World Turns” due to mismanagement, Miller rekindled his acting aspirations in 2006, appearing in an episode of “CSI: NY.” The pivotal moment arrived when he secured the role of Richie Novak in the ABC Daytime soap opera.</p><p>Miller’s remarkable talents led him to his enduring role as Billy Abbott in “The Young and the Restless,” which commenced on September 19, 2008. He became the fourth contract actor to embody this iconic character and received widespread acclaim, earning his first Emmy win for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010.</p><p>Beyond the realm of soap operas, Miller expanded his acting horizons. He made appearances in projects like “Ringer” on the CW Network and portrayed Gabe Watson in the Lifetime made-for-TV movie “Fatal Honeymoon.”</p><p>In September 2014, Miller embraced a significant role as Jason Morgan in “General Hospital,” announced by executive producer Frank Valentini. His portrayal garnered further recognition, earning him a nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in 2018. In an intriguing twist, Miller’s character transitioned into the role of Drew Cain, following Steve Burton’s return as Jason in 2017.</p><p>In July 2019, Miller made the decision to conclude his tenure on “General Hospital,” marking the conclusion of an illustrious career that left an indelible mark on the world of soap operas.</p><p>Billy Miller passed away in Austin, Texas, on September 15, 2023. While the precise cause of his passing remains undisclosed, his manager revealed that Miller was contending with manic depression during that period.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Billy Miller’s Parents?</h2><p>At the time of his death, details about his parents were not known, however, they seem to have been supportive parents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfqGWRp7Jursilo7JlnZ65rbHRrGSpmaKau7W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-sabre-norris-dating-now-past-relationships-current-status-and-rumours-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Sabre Norris Dating Now?
