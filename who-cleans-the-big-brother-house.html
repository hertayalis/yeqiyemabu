During the Wednesday, Sept. 4 episode, Jackson, Jess, Cliff, Christie, Tommy, and Nicole literally destroyed the reality show's famous abode, so now fans are wondering: Who cleans the <a href=#>Big Brother house</a>? <strong>Scroll down for everything we know!</strong></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who cleans the Big Brother house?</h2><p>To no shock, the Big Brother house doesn't clean itself. In fact, the houseguests are responsible to do so!</p><p>“It’s up to the houseguests to do their own cleaning, and some casts are real slobs and some are really neat,” Executive Producer of Big Brother, Allison Grodner, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> in 2017. “Inevitably there’s a neatnik in the cast. You start to hear, ‘I’m the only one scrubbing and cleaning.’”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>The houseguests are flipping the v̶o̶t̶e̶s̶ ̶HOUSE in tonight’s NEW #BB21!

There are times when we’ve walked into the house and quickly leave. It’s pretty dirty and doesn’t smell the best.”&nbsp;</p><p>Funny enough, it seems living in the Big Brother house could be similar to feeling like you're in college again. “It smells like feet,” Grodner added.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have a discussion ahead of time about ‘production issues’ or ‘roommate issues’ and cleanliness is definitely a roommate issue, like if someone decides to be a complete slob and pile things up in the sink. We’ve had plenty of stories from people watching the show online about contestants coming out of the toilet and not washing their hands."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I took some shots of some of my favorite details from the #BB21 House.

That said, if someone is sloppy in the house, it could for sure make the houseguests want to send them home.</p><p>"They’re playing a game and no one wants that [complaining] to be the reason they end up being nominated [for eviction] or being evicted,” Meehan added. “Last year, someone tried putting up rules about cleaning — and that person got evicted first.”&nbsp;</p><p>The LA-based house, which is located on a set, by the way, also features some insanely cool competitions throughout the seasons, typically in the backyard. However, we don't think the houseguests are responsible for cleaning those up by the looks of the live feeds. We imagine the CBS staff and crew come in and out of the yard when it comes to competition setups and takedowns.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The one thing to note about the house is that every season a new crew comes in. And with a fresh set of houseguests means a new (and clean!) look for them. That said, the Season 22 cast will be lucky considering the messes we've season on Season 21 thus far (who could ever forget Jess, Cliff, and Nicole repeatedly throwing pies in people's faces for a week even though they always made it to the floor instead).</p><p>"It’s a set, so it gets demolished, then rebuilt,” Grodner shared. “Prior to the [new] houseguests entering, we go in with an industrial cleaning crew and make sure the filth from the past season is gone. It’s like a construction site — it has to be vacuumed out and hosed down.” Phew!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecKlnJqmo2LBqbGMm6CgZZKnvLW0xKtkoaelqLI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-joel-osteen-controversy-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Joel Osteen controversy, explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./seagate-signs-hamr-deal-with-showa-denko-secures-second-source-for-hamr-platters.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Secures Second Source for HAMR Platters</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./773357-deion-sanders-reacts-deiondras-pregnancy-jokes-granddaddy-hip-hop-news.html>Deion Sanders Reacts To Deiondra's Pregnancy, Jokes About Being A &amp;quot;Granddaddy&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirara-asuka-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Kirara Asuka Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lucky-spencers-exit-from-gh.html>Lucky Spencer's exit from GH - General Hospital</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prince-william-kuwait-trip.html>Prince William Follows Prince Charles &amp;amp; the Queen's Footsteps in Kuwait</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rajon-rondo-bio-height-team-net-worth-and-more.html>Rajon RondoBio, Height, Team, Net Worth and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog.
