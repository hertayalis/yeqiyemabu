She is well-known for her roles as a co-host on The View in the daytime from 2016 to 2017 and as an anchor on the weekend edition of Fox & Friends in the morning from 2019 to 2021. She has published two other books as well. Her own podcast, Jedediah Bila LIVE on Valuetainment, debuted in June 2022 with her as host.</p><p>Jedediah Bila, born and raised in Brooklyn, holds a Master of Arts from Columbia University and graduated from Wagner College. She started out in New York as a teacher in 2005. Students in middle school, high school, and college took her classes in improvisation, Spanish, and creative writing. Additionally, she has held the position of academic dean at a private school in New York City.</p><p>Career</p><p>In 2009, Bila made the switch from academia to politics when she published a blog review of the book Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto by radio presenter Mark Levin. Later, Levin read the assessment on the air, which led Sean Hannity of the Fox News program, Hannity, to ask her to appear. She began working as a contributor for Fox News in 2013. She started participating on the Outnumbered panel as a guest in April 2014. She also frequently appears on “The Five,” a chat show.</p><p>In August 2016, Bila left Fox News to become a permanent co-host of the ABC daytime talk show The View for its twentieth season. She played the role of the conservative co-host to the liberal ones while she was a part of the show. For the Lifetime program Abby Tells All, she spoke with television personality Abby Lee Miller in 2017. In the same year, on September 18, Bila left The View.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old Jedediah Bila?</h2><p>Jedediah Bila is 43 years old, she was born on January 29, 1979.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s Jedediah Bila’s height and weight?</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What nationality is Jedediah Bila?</h2><p>She is an American by birth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Jedediah Bila get married?</h2><p>In February 2018, Bila and Jeremy Scher got married.
